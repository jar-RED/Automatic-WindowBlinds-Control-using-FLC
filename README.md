# Automatic-WindowBlinds-Control-using-FLC

A simple fuzzy logic control system in Python that controls the position of window blinds/curtains based on two inputs: light intensity (0-100) and time of day (24-hour format). It utilizes the fuzzylogic library and Matplotlib to visualize the membership functions of the input and output variables.

1. Run the auto-windowBlinds-flc.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
